## Python script
Inside the ```Exam``` folder, you'll find a Python script called ```computeConvolution.py``` which you can use to check and evaluate your Convolution results (<i>Exercise 1 in Amerini part of the Exam</i>).

To use the script, just set the arguments:
<br>
- ```convolution``` = "True" for using Convolution. "False" for using Correlation
- ```image``` = Image matrix written in the exam paper
- ```kernel_init``` = Kernel matrix written in the exam paper
- ```padding``` = Padding to choose.
- ```C``` = Constant value if using the 'zero' or 'constant' padding
- ```coord``` = Coordinates written in the exam paper
<br>

Then, simply run the script.<br>
If you spot any bug or any inconsistency with the results, please write me at gianmarcoscarano@gmail.com and I'll check it up.
